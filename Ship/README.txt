Controls:
W - Moves forward
S - stops
A/D - Turns wheel, the ship turns the direction of the wheel relative to the nose of the ship
	- Additionally, can use mouse to click and turn the wheel left and right

Q/E - Fires side cannons

Future Ideas:
- Mortar: Stops the ship, zooms out and creates a radius where you can click and fire a hard-hitting explosive that deals MASSIVE damage (high cooldown)
- Ramming: Hitting ships with your ship deals damage to both you and your ship, perhaps more damage done depending on where the ship is hit
